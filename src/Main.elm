    """
As part of COVID-19 response, some schools are dividing students into "cohorts" for in-person learning. Students and teachers in a cohort meet only with one another. This strategy is intended to limit the number of people exposed to a person who is positive COVID-19 in a school -- if someone in a cohort acquires COVID-19 in the community, only the people in that cohort need to subsequently quarantine and test.

In a "cohort" strategy, the probability of having one person of a cohort positive for COVID-19 is dependent on: community transmission rates, size of cohort.  The probability of having a cohort in a district test positive depends on these factors, as well as the number of cohorts. 

This is a simple tool to help schools evaluate how often an individual cohort is likely to have a COVID-positive person or people in it, and how often one or more cohorts, out of many in a district, are likely to have COVID-positive people in them.

This tool examines both the likelihood that a cohort has someone infected on day one -- which is to say, the first day that students walk into the classroom -- and the likelihood of later infections impacting cohorts.

This tool makes the simplifying assumption that everyone in a community has the same risk of being infected, based on the community new-case-rate, regardless of age and other distinguishing characteristics.

This model *only* describes the probability that a person arrives at the school COIVD-19 positive due to community transmission.  This model does NOT say anything about transmission within a cohort or within a school.   Transmission within a cohort or school will be dependent on a variety of factors, including but not limited to: cohort strategy, masking, social distancing, disinfection, and ventilation strategy.  None of these are modeled here.
